# Modelica Buildings library

This is the developer version for teh VUMACS lab of the Modelica Buildings Library originally created by LBNL. Currently, we are trying to modify the ASHRAE2006 control strategy by controlling different parameters of the 5 Zone VAV Reheat example

In the first iteration, we have created "Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.RLPPOV1" where we are testing only the Heating Set point control by passing random inputs to understand the behavior of the model. The preliminary instruction and results of setting up the test bed are in RLPPOV1 folder.

TODO: In later versions we will test and implement
